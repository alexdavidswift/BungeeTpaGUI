# BungeeTP  
Welcome to your new project!

This plugin brings a new dimension to teleportation, providing seamless and efficient teleport commands for players navigating across your Waterfall/Velocity network.


**Key Features:**

**Cross-Server Teleportation:** BungeeTP enables players to effortlessly teleport to each other between different servers within your Waterfall/Velocity network. Whether it's a hub, minigame server, or survival world, your players can seamlessly traverse the vast landscapes of your Minecraft universe.

**Player-Friendly Commands:** With intuitive and easy-to-use teleport commands, players can quickly teleport to each other between servers.

**Permission System:** Admins have full control over who can access specific teleportation commands. Set up a robust permission system to manage teleportation privileges and maintain server security.

**Configuration Options:** Fine-tune the plugin to suit your server's unique needs. Customize teleport request expiration times, teleportation delays (to bypass delays: bungeetp.cooldown.bypass), and other parameters (coming soon) to create a teleportation system tailored to your server's gameplay style.
